Description: Applying the global sensitivity analysis workflow to investigate the parameter uncertainty and sensitivity in pharmacokinetic (PK) models, especially the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model with multivariate outputs. The package also provide some functions to check the sensitivity measures and its convergence of model parameters.
